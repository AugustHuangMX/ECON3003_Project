This is the project from the course ECON3003 Econometrics II in University of Macau.

The main.ipynb is my sample solution of the questions. And main.typ is the essay-type report of the project.
The data is from the course, so I cannot guarantee the data you are given in your semester is the same as mine.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
